<p>For Mac users we have an installer with all necessary dependencies to get the Styleguide working.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The &#39;Start&#39; app, will install everything you need. Please check the <a href="#know-issues">Known Issues</a> section before running this app. When it&#39;s finished the Styleguide will open automaticaly in you browser. If you already have all the dependencies installed in your computer, the Styleguide will open.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The &#39;Compile&#39; app creates a static version of the Styleguide in a &#39;www&#39; folder.</p>
