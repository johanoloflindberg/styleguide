<p>The Styleguide is completely modular. This means two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Content is separated from code</li>
<li>Code is split in independent modules</li>
</ul>
<p>With this in mind, we recommend you to learn how to use the system before moving on to building your project&#39;s styleguide.</p>
<h5>_data.json files</h5><ul>
<li>In these files are all the textual content and configurations. </li>
<li>There&#39;s one in the styleguide folder and one inside each module.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Generated files</h5><ul>
<li>In the assets/scripts folder a file will be generated if you want to import all of your modules Javascript into your project.</li>
<li>In the assets/styles folder a file will be generated if you want to import all of your modules Stylesheet into your project.</li>
</ul>
